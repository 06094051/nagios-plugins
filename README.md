nagios-plugins
==============

Advanced Nagios Plugins Collection

I`ve been developing this since around 2006. It covers a significant range of infrastructure services and is highly recommended that all Nagios users consider becoming familiar with these tools.

Despite the recent timestamps this is actually an aggregation of various sources where I`ve previously released my code publicly to now finally come under one place for better maintainance and support


The first thing you need to do is to get my library submodule since I share code between this and other things that I have written over the years.


CD to the nagios-plugins directory and run the following 2 commands to pull in the library submodule:


git submodule init

git submodule update
