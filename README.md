nagios-plugins
==============

Advanced Nagios Plugins Collection

I've been developing this since around 2006. It covers a significant range of infrastructure services and is highly recommended that all Nagios users consider becoming familiar with these tools.

Despite the recent timestamps this is actually an aggregation of various sources where I've previously released my code publicly to now finally come under one place for better maintainance and support


### Setup ###
The first thing you need to do is to get my library submodule since I share code between this and other things that I have written over the years.

Enter the directory and run git submodule init and git submodule update to fetch my library repo:

```
cd nagios-plugins
```
```
git submodule init
```
```
git submodule update
```
